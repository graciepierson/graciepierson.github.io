<h3 class="underline"> Excerpt from the short story "M" </h3>
<div class="shortstoryexcerpt">
<p>I let out a long exhale trying to think of a way out of this one, but she drones on.
“It won’t be more than 15… maybe 20 people. Charlie and the rest of your crew are in! It will be swell!” 
</p>

<P>I keep my eyes straight, focused on the stoplight ahead. The sun is starting to make its slow descent toward the horizon and Ellen’s voice becomes background noise. Sunset is Mom’s favorite time of day. Seated on the patio, glass of gin in hand, Mom never skipped a day waiting for the green flash. The moment when the last sliver of sun disappears into the ocean, colors of vibrant yellow and blue collide causing a green flash to sprint across the sky. Maybe I was too impatient, or blinked at the wrong time, but I never saw the green flash, well I saw it, you are just going to have to focus a lot harder tomorrow, she would say with a warm tinge of liquor coating her breath. </P> 
	
<P> The silence in the car brings me back, and Ellen is staring at me, waiting for my response. I reluctantly cave, as she expects. It is my eighteenth birthday, after all. 
“Okay, fine, but I am not cleaning up your mess in the morning.” Ellen grins, dolphining her hand out the open window. The light turns green and I pull through the intersection. The ocean breeze wafts through the car as we pass Zuma.
</P>

<P>We pull into the driveway and I park my van off to the right. The house is empty. With most of the exterior walls being glass, the vacancy is apparent. The silence is palpable. The front door opens with ease as Ellen and I enter, Ellen retreats straight to her room. I stop, frozen facing the vast ocean out in front of me. Huge glass panels are the only barrier between me and the outside. The waves crash and the white water flushes below my feet. I’m suspended in this crystal box, looking out. The blanket of blue green extends for miles, only one boat intruding on its continuous line. If the waves were big enough, a wall of white wash would swallow the entire living room, obviating any view out. It’s overwhelming, sometimes I can’t see past the stiff picture reflected in the glass. I pivot away from this expansiveness, my tennis shoes screaching against the concrete floors. Doris left a note on the entry way saying that she had to leave early to pick her daughter up from daycare, leftovers are in the fridge for dinner. Doris is the only one that makes any use out of the kitchen. With Mom away and Dad constantly working, she keeps an eye on me and Ellen. Doris makes sure we eat, have clean sheets, and that Ellen doesn’t destroy everything in the house. 
</P>
	
<P> I retreat to my room. The space is lined with surfboards mounted on the walls and 35 mm prints taped sporadically below. It’s my space. Most of the photographs are of Cassie. They don’t always show the full picture, but zoomed-in detail of her face, her hands, smile. And those eyes. There are some shots at Zuma beach from that major swell that hit a couple weeks ago. I’ve been getting some use out of one of Dad’s old Canons I found in a box in the shed. It’s not like he uses it, and they let me use the darkroom at school in my spare time. 
</P>
	
<P> I toss my backpack down on the bed and load one of my new vinyls on the record player, adjusting the volume to that sweet spot. I reach into the bottom drawer of my desk and pull out the cardboard box. It contains a notebook, pencil, pipe, canister, and some matches. I open my window and sit on the ledge, letting my feet dangle towards the sand below. The sky is clear, with Catalina’s silhouette placed in the distance to the right. My room faces more south, exposing all of Santa Monica Bay curved out in front of me, the mountains closely hugging from behind. 
</P>

<P>I light up a bowl and exhale the day. Feeling the tip of the dull pencil between my fingertips, I think of Cassie’s lips, the softness of her lower back, and the way her eyes roll when I tell her she is beautiful. I open the notebook and write, you, Love, are all I see. The pages of the notebook flutter with the breeze. The sky has reached that level of dim where the world is warmed in color. I place the pencil in between the pages and put the journal back in the box. I take another hit from the pipe and close my eyes. The back of my eyelids are orange with heat. I can feel the glow dissipating from my face, specks of light slowly being removed off the surface of my skin. Relaxing against the window frame, I feel the stillness of the quiet around me. It’s suffocating.
