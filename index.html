	Doors
	Press the silver button to open the gate, but not from the outside, on the outside you enter the code and push. It is not gonna be easy, you have to kind of… nudge it. And then, this is when you press the silver button, No—- not just after you open the gate, wait—-maybe I won’t call it a gate. It is more of a door, a hefty one with a huge handle. But after you open the door (that is much like a gate) you walk through the courtyard and open the glass door, which does not have a code, you just push it open, this one doesn’t take much effort, a gentle nudge will do. Finally you can enter, its empty, walls of glass, a vast space that appears to have no exit but one, except there are other doors, some standard with knobs on the left, or right, depending on what side you are standing on, twist and open. But there are also some barn doors, that hang on a track, above the doorway, these ones slide, so guide the handle to the right, or two the left, depending on what side you are standing on. Besides a few regular—-”regular” doors and some barn style ones (installed for aesthetic purposes) there are no more doors in this space. Oh—-and there is the mechanical folding door too, to get to it you slide the barn door to the passageway, turn the knob of the door at the other end. Then you are at the mechanical door, to open this door you simply press the button mounted on the wall, the bottom button, the door will then start to peel up, folding at the corner and flattening parallel to the ceiling. But don’t leave the space this way, the opening is not meant for you, turn back around and exit by turning the knob back through the passageway, slide the barn door to the right (yes to the right this time) and leave. Go back through the glass door, it pivots by the way and is wider than most doors, yet it still will open easily. Walk out back through the courtyard and you will reach this door, or gate, the one with the silver button. The button will be on your right, press the button and pull on the handle at the same time. It is going to be difficult, the door is heavy, so you have to put some weight into it. Remember you must press the silver button.
